**Q: What size jobs do we work on?**
_A: We have completed projects ranging from $500 to $200,000._

**Q: Do we provide free estimates?**
_A: Yes, we do._

**Q: Do we charge a design fee?**
_A: Many estimates and proposals can be done without a formal plan. Our designers can provide an informal sketch, FREE of charge with your estimate. If you need a formal landscape plan, there will be a modest charge which is applied as a credit to the overall landscape invoice if Albro Land Corporation is hired to complete the work._

**Q: Are we Bonded and Insured?**
_A: Yes, we are. Certificates of insurance are available upon request. Performance bonds add 5% to 10% to the job and are available upon request._

**Q: Where do we purchase materials?**
_A: We are a small Chicago business and we support local growers and suppliers._

**Q: Do we guarantee plants?**
_A: We will guarantee, for a period of one year from the date of installation, all plant material and labor costs except the following: Japanese Maples, Roses, Rhododendron, Perennials, and all plants not designated for Zone 5._

* Note: In order to keep guarantees in force, all invoices must be paid within 30 days of invoice. The guarantee is also contingent on the customer watering plants as needed. This guarantee does not cover damage from animals, ice, snow, wind, or poor use of chemicals.

**Q: Do we guarantee sod and annual flowers?**
_A: No. Sod and annual flowers can be the fastest and most efficient way to add color and value to your landscape. Unfortunately, both sod and annual flowers are also the most drought-sensitive items we install._

* Sod and annual flowers are guaranteed fresh upon installation but are not guaranteed after installation, unless Albro Land Corporation is contracted for watering and care post-installation.
